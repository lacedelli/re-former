# Forms project

## Thoughts before dropping in

Rails is slowly but surely warming its way into my heart. With each program
I make I realize just how much thought went into designing the underlying
structure that permeates the evironment, and how easy really all this is;
which, in all honesty, still strikes me as impressive, but I genuinely do 
like it a lot more than I used to just a couple of weeks ago.

Now it's the time for forms! I'm in all honesty, intimidated by them, but
I do realize that it's mostly my lack of familiarity with them what's making
me feel unsettled; it'll come with practice, I guess.
